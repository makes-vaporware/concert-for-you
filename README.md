# Concert For You

I wanted to get good at the Deltarune piano, so I made a copy of it. [You can play it here, too!](https://makes-vaporware.github.io/concert-for-you/)

### How to Play

Play notes with Z.
Hold down the arrow keys to modulate the note being played.
Hold down C to lower the octave of the note being played.

### Credits

All sprites and soundfonts are from [Deltarune](deltarune.com) by Toby Fox. It's a great game. Play it.

Added thanks to [this comment by u/Apprehensive_Law_118](https://www.reddit.com/r/Underminers/comments/wzy7n7/comment/mzn2jt0) for helping me get the assets needed super quickly.
